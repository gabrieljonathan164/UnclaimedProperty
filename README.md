# Unclaimed Property Analysis Project - Data Wrangling Project focused on Data Cleaning, Extraction, Transformation and Reporting

## Overview
This project aims to analyze unclaimed property data to assist financial and accounting institutions in auditing and reporting unclaimed assets in compliance with state laws.

## Problem Statement

## Analysis
The project involved data wrangling of datasets from California and Massachusetts, focusing on property types and holders. Financial institutions were identified as the primary holders of unclaimed property.

## Results
Dashboards were created to visualize the number of unclaimed properties, rankings by property types, and trends over time. The analysis highlighted the importance of checking and savings accounts among unclaimed assets.

## Solution
The project provides insights that can help financial institutions audit their unclaimed assets and comply with state unclaimed property laws. It emphasizes the need for banks to focus on checking and savings accounts.

## How to Use
The dashboards and analysis can be used by financial institutions to identify and prioritize the types of unclaimed property that require attention for auditing and reporting purposes.
